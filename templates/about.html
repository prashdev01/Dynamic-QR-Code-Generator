    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>The generate_qr_code function takes the data you want to encode (e.g., a URL) and an optional output path for
        the generated QR code image. It uses the qrcode library to generate the QR code and saves it as a PNG file.
        The display_qr_code function takes the path to the generated QR code image and uses the Pillow library to
        open and display the image.
        Make sure to replace the data_to_encode variable with the actual data you want to encode in the QR code.

        Note: Depending on your operating system and Python environment, the img.show() method may not work as
        expected. If that's the case, you might need to use a different approach to display the image, such as
        opening it with the default image viewer or a specific application.</p>
